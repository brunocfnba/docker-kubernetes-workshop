# Using a Dockerfile
What if I tell you there's even a simpler way to create your images!?
I'm talking about Dockerfiles which allows us to actually "develop infrastructure". Using Dockerfile we can create our images in a more consistent way, store it using Git, develop it in collaboration, implement devOps and a lot more.
We are going to use a Dcokerfile I've already create to build our image and run our container.
